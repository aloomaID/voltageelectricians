                    <h2>Why does my circuit breaker keep tripping?</h2>
                    <p>Experiencing frequent circuit breaker trips can be both frustrating and concerning. At Voltage Electricians, serving Rancho Santa Margarita California we understand how important it is to identify and resolve the underlying issues causing your circuit breaker to trip.<br>Overloaded Circuits<br>One of the most common reasons for a tripping circuit breaker is an overloaded circuit. When too many devices or appliances are connected to a single circuit, it can draw more power than the circuit is designed to handle. This excess load triggers the breaker to shut off to prevent overheating and potential fires. To address this, redistribute your electrical load by unplugging some devices or upgrading to additional circuits.<br>Short Circuits<br>Short circuits occur when a hot wire comes into contact with a neutral wire or ground. This creates a path of low resistance, causing a surge of electrical current that trips the breaker. Common causes include damaged wiring or faulty appliances. If you suspect a short circuit, it’s essential to have a professional electrician inspect and repair the wiring.<br>Ground Faults<br>A ground fault happens when a hot wire touches a ground wire or metal outlet box. This can be dangerous and leads to the breaker tripping. Ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) are designed to detect and prevent such issues, especially in areas with moisture like kitchens and bathrooms. Ensure GFCIs are installed and functioning correctly.<br>Breaker Malfunction<br>Sometimes, the circuit breaker itself may be faulty or worn out. If your breaker trips frequently despite no obvious overloads or faults, it might need replacement. A licensed electrician can assess and replace the breaker if necessary.<br>For expert troubleshooting and repair of circuit breaker issues in Rancho Santa Margarita California trust Voltage Electricians. Contact us today to ensure your electrical system operates safely and efficiently, keeping your home secure and powered.</p>
